WLS filter: Edge-preserving smoothing based onthe weightd least squares
optimization framework, as described in Farbman, Fattal, Lischinski, and
Szeliski, "Edge-Preserving Decompositions for Multi-Scale Tone and Detail
Manipulation", ACM Transactions on Graphics, 27(3), August 2008.

Given an input image IN, we seek a new image OUT, which, on the one hand,
is as close as possible to IN, and, at the same time, is as smooth as
possible everywhere, except across significant gradients in L.
